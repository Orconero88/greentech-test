# Greentech technical review
The project uses Node 21.1 and TypeScript.
Simple guidelines to start the project:

 ## Install 

To run the project start by cloning the repository (greentech-test).

Then:
 

     npm install
     
	
first time only.

    npm run build
    
then

    npm run start

I wrote some tests TDD-wise that you can analyze with the command:
 

    npm test
